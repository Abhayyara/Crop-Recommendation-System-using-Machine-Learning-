# Crop-Recommendation-System-using-Machine-Learning-
Excited to share one of my recent projects — a Crop Recommendation System built using Python, Flask, and Machine Learning!

🔍 Project Overview:
This system predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on environmental and soil parameters such as:

Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium
Temperature 🌡️
Humidity 💧
pH level ⚗️
Rainfall ☔

🧠 The backend uses a trained Decision Tree Classifier, and the model is served through a Flask web app. Users input the required data through a responsive Bootstrap-based interface, and the system provides crop recommendations with an intuitive result display.

📦 Tech Stack:

Python
Scikit-learn
Flask
HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
Pickle for model serialization

💡 Goal: To assist farmers and agriculture advisors in making data-driven decisions that lead to better yield and sustainable farming.
